# Project-Management
These are projects I did in school as part of the Projects Course. These projects helped me build soft skills such as leadership, effective communication, teamwork, adaptability, time management and critical thinking.
I also acquired technical skills such as planning, budgeting, risk management, scrum analysis, kanban boards, amongst others.
Above all, I got to learn how to use Trello for handling projects with multiple stakeholders.
